# Place your Github Actions workflow configurations in project_dir/.github/workflows/
#
# This configuration requires the following 4 repository secret variables:
# PRIVATE_KEY (which will contain the content of the private key for your repository. Either reuse the one from earlier, or better, make a new one.)
# KNOWN_HOSTS (contains a hash identifying the remote server as the genuine one. You will have the hash for the server in your local .ssh directory in the file known_hosts if you have connected to it before.)
# TARGET_HOST (the url for server when connecting with SSH. On one.com it has the form ssh.example.com)
# TARGET_USER (the SSH user for connecting to a remote server. On one.com the domain-name serves as the username, so it has the form of example.com).
#
# You are also required to update host_name for the SSH configuration on line 35 to match up with the host specified in your Deployer recipe.
